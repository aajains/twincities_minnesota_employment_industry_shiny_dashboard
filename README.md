# Twin Cities Minnesota Employment Industry Interactive Shiny Dashboard

Accommodation and Food Services

Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting

The data is for all cities in the seven counties in the metropolitan region:

Washington 

The data set is acquired from the [Metropoltian Council, Minnesota, United States](http://stats.metc.state.mn.us/data_download/DD_start.aspx) . The two sets of employment data, i.e., Jobs and Workers, are:

Jobs: This data set displays the number of jobs for selected city, year and industry type. This can also be thought of as the number of people working in that given area. These people may or may not be the residents of the same city.

Workers: This data set informs about the number of people employed in given city, year and industry type. This number can also be considered as the number of employed residents of selected area.

Finally, [here](https://ajain.shinyapps.io/datathon/) is the shiny app link to access the dashboard. Have fun!
